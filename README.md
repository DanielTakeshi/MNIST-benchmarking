# MNIST Tuning

Tuning of hyperparameters. Use the shell scripts and just use file redirecting,
as in `python stuff.py > file.txt`.

Some RMSProp observations after the coarse stage, with 55k training, best
validations:

1. lrate 0.001, wd 0.000001, v=1.275, t=1.402
2. lrate 0.001, wd 0.00001, v=1.285, t=1.462
3. lrate 0.005, wd 0.0, v=1.295, t=1.425
4. lrate 0.001, wd 0.0001, v=1.360, t=1.490
5. lrate 0.005, wd 0.000001, v=1.390, t=1.535

These are average values over 4 standard deviations. BTW.
